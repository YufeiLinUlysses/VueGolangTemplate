* Provides a connection to mongodb, insert, get

### Future Development
* Post Image data to db
* Delete, Update in db
* Create a blockchain service
* User authentication

## Python scripts

### Goal
To do data analysis and machine learning fast, potentially run on the server side as a linux crontab

### Current Feature
* Insert into mongodb

### Future Development
* Get, Delete, Update in db
* Machine learning examples
* Web Scraping

## Vue projects

### Goal
This is the front view part of the web page, predominantly used to satisfy user interaction

### Current Feature
* A basic router wireframe

### Future Development
* Multi-page routing
